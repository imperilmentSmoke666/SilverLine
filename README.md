# SilverLine V0.01

A fairly simplistic URL checker that hasn't got threading yet so may take awhile to go through lists so feel free to change the timeout to your liking. To use this efficently create two text files in the same folder as SilverLine.py and name these text files "sites.txt" & "working.txt" after that feel free to add as many URLS to the sites.txt list and run the program all the sites that work will be added to working.txt 


Things to come:
        -multithreading
        -Useragent
        -console way to determine timeout
 
 These will be added eventually but my life is kinda busy and im going through some stuff rn but im trying to give back to the comunity that's helped me code so many things before
