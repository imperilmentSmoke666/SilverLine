# SilverLine V0.01

A very simple url checker that determines if a site is working or not, please note that a useragent hasn't been put into place so you may get false positives on some sites. This was just a small project I wanted to work on and may be adding more to it. 

How to start: 
    Make 2 text files with the corresponding name, "sites.txt" "working.txt"
    place the list of urls into the sites.txt and then run it 
    sites that work will be placed into the working.txt
