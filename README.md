# SilverLine v0.1

A very simple and easy to use URL checker, all you need to do is create two text files "sites.txt" & "working.txt" then make sure they're placed in the same folder as SilverLine.py for it to work. 


I suggest using pycharm for running it and all you need to do is pip install requests then run the program.
